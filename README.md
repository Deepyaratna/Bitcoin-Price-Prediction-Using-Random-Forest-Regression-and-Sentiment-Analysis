# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Regression-and-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, I aim to predict the price of bitcoin using sentiment analysis from twitter data and financial features to support the sentiment, using Random Forrest Regression Machine Learning Algorithm.

Tools used:â€¨Programming Languages - Python and R
Data Cleaning Library- pandas, numpy, regex-re
Financial data API- yfinance, coinbase API
Dataset- Bitcoin tweets data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/bitcoin-tweets)
Data Visualisation Libraries - Matplotlib, plotly, seaborn
Sentiment Analysis/ NLP - vader, NLTK
Machine Learning Algorithms - Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree

The data_Processing.ipynb contains the my comprehensive data cleaning and data processing steps implemented. Since the bitcoin tweets.csv file that will be used has 95762468 data points, some cells might take a while to run. If you'd rather jump to just running the predictions, i have saved the cleaned and preprocessed dataset in the repository title - Bitcoin_tweets_Price_data.csv, after data cleaning. The code for making predictions are in prediction_model.ipynb
